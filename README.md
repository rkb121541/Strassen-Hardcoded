# Strassen Matrix Multiplication (Hardcoded)

This is [Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm). I used his method for multiplying 2x2 matrices. For multiplying 3x3 matrices, I used [this](). This is also Strassen's algorithm however he wrote

The whole purpose of using Strassen's algorithm instead of the standard way of doing matrix multiplication is to reduce the number of multiplications and reduce the runtime. Multiplication is a costly operation compared to addition. So, what Strassen did was reduce the number of multiplications but increased the number of additions.
